# YZSC2019
Source, Powerpoints and everything from YZSC 2019

## How to use this?

The powerpoints, test data, teachers' standard programs and everything that it **NOT** created by a student are in the master branch.

Create a branch in your name, put everything you've coded there.

You can merge your branch into the master branch **if and only if** what you've done are **approved by anyone else**, so open a pull request before you do so. 

To merge your work, create a new branch, you should put the prefix \[Done\] before its name, and put **only** what you want to merge in it.

We have **NO obligation** to keep what you have saved on this repository, nor do we have to keep them private.
